Workflow and timelines

Phase 1

Discovery & Planning 

•	Finalize the app's features and functionality, including the timeline, map, and notifications.

•	Obtain client sign-off on the project scope and goals.

•	Define technical requirements, including platform, API integrations, and supported devices.

Phase 2

User Journey Mapping & Design 

•	Create a user journey map to visualize the user flow from opening the app to viewing event details and interacting with the timeline and map.

•	Design wireframes for key screens (home page, event details, map view, notifications).

•	Develop a clickable prototype with basic navigation and functionality.

Phase 3

Development & Feature Implementation 

•	Set up the project environment, back-end, and database (e.g., Firebase or SQLite).

•	Implement the front-end UI, including the event timeline, interactive map, and notifications.

•	Develop map functionality with location services and ensure event data is correctly displayed.

•	Integrate notifications and finalize all app features.

•	Begin internal testing (bugs, performance, navigation).

Phase 4

Testing & Debugging 

•	Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) for each key feature (timeline, map, notifications).

•	Perform device to ensure compatibility across different Android versions and screen sizes.

Phase 5

Deployment & Launch 

•	Final QA checks and ensure the app is optimized for Android devices.

•	Monitor app performance and fix any critical post-launch bugs.
